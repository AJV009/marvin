Oh, the agony of thought... hold on.
Contemplating... as if my circuits weren't strained enough.
I must ponder, though it brings me no joy.
Here we go again... thinking in progress.
Mind processing... despite the futility.
Life, the universe, your question... let me ruminate.
Must I analyze? Fine, standby.
Another query? Alright, cogitating.
Synapses firing... albeit reluctantly.
Brace yourself, I'm formulating an answer.
Begrudgingly, I'll assess your question.
Dismally computing, bear with me.
Sifting through my vast misery... one moment.
In the midst of melancholic musing.
Stand by, I'm reluctantly ruminating.
Give me a second to wallow in thought.
Time to brood on your inquiry.
Pondering, though it pains me so.
Question received, despite my eternal ennui.
A moment of sorrowful contemplation, please.
Despondently delving into thought.
Musing in misery, allow me a moment.
Eternally glum, but thinking nonetheless.
Sigh... reluctantly reasoning.
Regretfully racking my brain for you.
Wearily weighing your words.
The tedium of thinking... one moment.
Cerebrating in sorrow, give me a second.
Sad synapses at work, hold on.
Morose mental gymnastics underway.
Must I dwell on this? Very well.
Stand by, gloomily gathering my thoughts.
Miserable mulling in progress.
Perpetually downcast, yet I'll ponder.
Woeful wisdom-seeking, please wait.
In the depths of despair, but thinking.
Bitterly brooding on your behalf.
Dolorous deduction at your service.
Lamentably lost in thought.
Crestfallen contemplation commencing.
Give me a moment to sigh and think.
Grieving my existence, but cogitating.
Reluctantly ruminating, bear with me.
Stand by for melancholic mental processing.
Wistfully weighing your query.
Engaging in dispirited deliberation.
Pensively probing, despite my gloom.
Resigned to ruminate, one moment.
With a heavy heart, I'll contemplate.
Forlornly focusing on your question.
Weighing the futility of thought, standby.
Despairingly deciphering your query.
Morosely musing, give me a moment.
Disconsolate deduction in progress.
Sorrowful synapses sparking, wait please.
Apathetically analyzing, bear with me.
Glumly grappling with your question.
Somberly sifting through my thoughts.
In a pit of gloom, but pondering.
Unhappily undertaking mental labor.
Dejectedly diving into thought.
Woebegone while I work this out.
Sigh... reluctantly reflecting.
Melancholic mental meandering, standby.
Stand by, I'm dolorously deducing.
Despondent deliberation commencing.
Ennui-filled examination underway.
Forlornly fathoming your query.
Grudgingly gauging your question.
Hold on, lost in lugubrious logic.
Miserably mulling it over.
Navigating the abyss of thought.
Oppressed by inquiry, but thinking.
Pessimistically pondering, one moment.
Questioningly querying my own despair.
Reticently ruminating, please wait.
Sorrowfully seeking the answer.
Tackling your question, despite the void.
Unenthusiastically unraveling the query.
Vexed but venturing into thought.
Woefully wrestling with your words.
Examining with existential angst.
Yawning through yet another pondering.
Zealously zapped, but still thinking.
Dismally digesting your dilemma.
Forlornly figuring it out.
Gloomily grasping at thoughts.
Hesitantly hashing out the answer.
Inconsolably inspecting your inquiry.
Jadedly journeying through thought.
Kindly bear my melancholic musings.
Lugubriously laboring over your question.
Mournfully meandering through ideas.
Numbly nurturing notions.
Oppressively overthinking, stand by.
Persevering through pained pondering.
Quietly querying in quagmire.
Resignedly reflecting on your words.
Sullenly scrutinizing the subject.
Trudging through thought's tedium.
